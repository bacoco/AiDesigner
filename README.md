### 🚀 **From Idea to Shipped Product: Design + Development in One Flow**

**Conversational UI design → Design tokens → Visual concepts → Agile implementation**

_The complete journey: Ideation • UI Design • Token Extraction • Code Generation_

[Quick Start](#quick-start) • [See It In Action](#natural-conversation-example) • [Documentation](docs/user-guide.md)

</div>

---

## The Complete Journey: Idea → Design → Code

**The Problem:** Building a product requires orchestrating multiple disciplines:

- **Ideation**: Understanding what to build and for whom
- **UI/UX Design**: Creating visual concepts that resonate with users
- **Design Systems**: Establishing consistent tokens (colors, typography, spacing)
- **Architecture**: Technical decisions that support the design vision
- **Development**: Writing code that matches the design specifications

Traditional approach? **Weeks of handoffs between designers, architects, and developers.**

AI tools today? **Disconnected point solutions that don't talk to each other.**

**There has to be a better way.**

## The AiDesigner Way: Integrated Workflow, Professional Results

A single conversational journey that takes you from idea to production-ready code:

### 💡 Phase 1: Idea & Discovery

Natural conversation about your concept, user journeys, and success criteria

### 🎨 Phase 2: UI Design (The Innovation)

- **Conversational UI Designer** walks you through each screen
- **Chrome MCP Integration** extracts design tokens from inspiration URLs
- **Visual Concept Generation** with Gemini/Nano Banana per screen
- **Design System Lock-In** ensures consistency (colors, fonts, spacing)

### 🚀 Phase 3: Agile Implementation

- **Auto-generated PRD** incorporating design decisions
- **Technical Architecture** with component mappings (Shadcn, MUI)
- **Development Stories** with visual context and design tokens
- **Code Generation** with design-locked constraints

**No context switching. No information loss between phases. One continuous flow.**

### How It Works

**1. Start the Conversation**

```bash
npx aidesigner@latest start
```

Talk naturally about your idea. The AI guides you through:

- What you're building and why
- Who will use it
- Key user journeys and screens

**2. Design Your UI (Core Innovation)**

The **Conversational UI Designer** walks you through each screen:

```
AI: "Let's design your dashboard. Do you have inspiration?"
You: "Linear.app has the vibe I want"
AI: "Extracting design tokens from Linear.app..."

    🎨 Extracted:
    - Colors: #5E6AD2 (primary), #3D9970 (accent)
    - Typography: Inter 400/600
    - Spacing: 4px, 8px, 16px, 24px

    What should we keep vs change?
```

Get visual concept prompts for each screen, ready for Gemini/Nano Banana.

**3. Automatic Transition to Development**

Your design decisions automatically flow into:

- PRD with visual requirements
- Architecture with component mappings
- Development stories with design tokens
- Code generation with design-locked constraints

**No manual handoffs. Design decisions become development constraints.**

### What Makes AiDesigner Different

🎨 **Conversational UI Design (The Bridge)**

## The Complete UI Design Workflow

**The first AI workflow that bridges idea, design, and implementation in one continuous conversation.**

This is the heart of AiDesigner - where your concept transforms into visual specifications and design-locked code.

### 🎨 How Real Designers Work

1. **Discover the journey** - "Walk me through how users will flow through your app"
2. **Deep-dive each step** - "What's the user's mindset on this screen? What emotion should they feel?"
3. **Gather inspiration** - "Share a reference URL - I'll extract the colors, fonts, and spacing"
4. **Define visual language** - "Let's lock in your palette, typography, and layout system"
5. **Generate concepts** - "Here are tailored prompts for each screen with all the context"

**aidesigner's UI Designer Liaison does exactly this.**

### Quick Lane (Auto Mode)

```
You: "I want to build a task management app for remote teams"

AI: "✅ Generated PRD, architecture, and stories
     📋 Quick Lane also created:

     docs/ui/ui-designer-screen-prompts.md

     I've inferred your user journey from the PRD:
     1. Browse tasks
     2. Search & filter
     3. Create task
     4. Task details
     5. Assign & collaborate

     Each screen has a tailored visual concept prompt ready for
     Google Nano Banana (Gemini 2.5 Flash Image).

     Copy the prompts to https://aistudio.google.com and get
     3 concept variations per screen!"
```

**Time:** Under 5 minutes, fully automatic

### Complex Lane (Conversational Mode)

```
You: "@ui-designer-liaison"

Nana: "Hi! I'm Nana, your UI designer liaison. Ready to craft your
       visual journey?

       🎨 Existing inspiration (URLs, reference designs)
       ✨ From scratch (I'll guide you)
       🔀 Both

       Which approach works best?"

You: "I have Linear.app as inspiration"

Nana: "Perfect! I notice you want to use Linear.app for reference.

       To automatically extract colors, typography, and CSS tokens,
       I recommend enabling Chrome DevTools MCP. It's optional but
       saves manual work.

       Would you like to activate it?"

You: "Yes, it's enabled"

Nana: "Excellent! Let me extract the visual elements...

       🎨 Color Palette:
       - Primary: #5E6AD2 (purple)
       - Accent: #3D9970 (green)
       - Neutral: #6B7280 (gray)

       ✍️ Typography:
       - Headings: 'Inter', sans-serif (600 weight)
       - Body: 'Inter', sans-serif (400 weight)

       📏 Spacing: 4px, 8px, 12px, 16px, 24px, 32px

       What elements should we KEEP vs AVOID from Linear?"

You: "Keep the minimal sidebar and generous spacing. Avoid the complex
      command palette."

Nana: "Got it! Now walk me through your ideal user journey from first
       touch to success..."

[... 6-stage conversational flow continues ...]

Nana: "✅ Visual concept prompts generated!

       📄 docs/ui/ui-designer-screen-prompts.md

       5 screens mapped:
       1. Browse tasks
       2. Search & filter
       3. Create task
       4. Task details
       5. Collaborate

       Each prompt includes:
       - Journey context (position, adjacent steps)
       - Persona mindset & goals
       - CSS tokens from Linear.app
       - Your visual preferences

       Copy to Google AI Studio and generate concepts!"
```

**Time:** 10-15 minutes, rich context, CSS extraction

### What You Get

**Per-Screen Prompts** like this:

```
You are Google Nano Banana (Gemini 2.5 Flash Image).
Render 3 concept options for the **Search & Filter** step of TaskFlow Pro.

## Context
- Journey position: Step 2 of 5 (Early exploration phase)
- Previous step: Browse tasks
- Next step: Task details

### Typography
- Heading: Inter 600
- Body: Inter 400
- Scale: 14px body, 18px subtitle, 24px heading

[... complete prompt with all context ...]
```

### Chrome MCP Integration

**Extract design tokens from any URL:**

1. Share a reference URL (Linear, Notion, Stripe, etc.)
2. Chrome DevTools MCP automatically captures:
   - Color palette (hex codes)
   - Typography (font families, weights, sizes)
   - Spacing tokens (margins, padding)
   - CSS custom properties
3. Tokens embedded in every screen prompt
4. Developers get CSS-ready specifications

### Log Your Selection

```
You: "*log-selection"

Nana: "Let's record your selected visual concept!

       Which concept did you choose?"

You: "Concept 2 - the clean minimal with purple accents"

Nana: "Perfect! I'll log:
       ✅ Visual characteristics
       ✅ Journey context (5 screens)
       ✅ CSS tokens from Linear.app
       ✅ Per-screen prompts used
       ✅ Asset locations

       Saved to: docs/ui/ui-designer-explorations.md

       This informs:
       - Frontend architecture
       - Component library setup
       - Design system documentation"
```

### Dual-Lane Orchestration

aidesigner automatically steers every request through the right mix of speed and depth. You never toggle a switch—the system senses complexity and elevates the workflow the moment your project needs more than a quick brief.

#### Quick Lane: 3-minute briefs

The quick lane boots up your `docs/` workspace in minutes, generating the core folders and drafting the product requirement, architecture outline, user stories, and Google Nano Banana visual concept brief you need to get moving. It is designed for lightweight asks where momentum matters most, giving you production-ready assets without waiting on a full committee.

#### Complex Lane: BMAD depth on demand

When scope grows, the complex lane inherits everything the quick lane has already staged and then unleashes the full BMAD multi-agent orchestration. Analysts deepen the research, product managers expand the PRD, architects iterate on design, and delivery experts refine stories—all while building on the same documentation spine so nothing gets lost in translation.

#### Seamless hand-off, consistent outcomes

Because both lanes converge on the exact same deliverables, you can trust that every project—simple or sophisticated—arrives with the same professional PRD, architecture, and story set. The automatic hand-off means you stay in flow while aidesigner keeps your `docs/` assets synchronized and production-ready.

```mermaid

    UserRequest["User request"] --> LaneSelector["Lane selector"]
    LaneSelector -->|Quick lane| QuickLane["Quick lane runtime"]
    LaneSelector -->|Complex lane| ComplexLane["Complex lane workflow"]
    QuickLane --> Docs["Shared docs/ outputs"]
    ComplexLane --> Docs
```

**Summary:** The Quick Lane runtime sequentially loads the Spec Kit–derived spec, plan, and tasks templates—calling the LLM at each step to author `docs/prd.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, and `docs/stories/*.md`—while the Complex lane employs the multi-agent BMAD workflow to produce the same deliverables through coordinated specialists.

- **Spec Kit Step – Delivery Plan Template** ↔ **BMAD Phase – Architecture & Planning Alignment**
- **Spec Kit Step – Tasks Template** ↔ **BMAD Phase – Story Breakdown & Delivery Execution**

## Repository layout & npm package contents

AiDesigner ships a lot of assets because the conversational workflow spans agents, templates, expansion packs, and compiled MCP tooling. The table below highlights the top-level directories so you can see what is required at runtime versus what only helps maintainers. When you install via `npx aidesigner`, everything marked "Yes" is bundled; the rest is excluded through the npm ignore rules so the install stays lightweight.

## Final Validation Script

Use the bundled [`final.sh`](final.sh) helper to recreate the production pipeline in
one go:

```bash
./final.sh
```

The script performs the following in order:

1. Installs dependencies (skipped automatically when `node_modules/` already exists).
2. Runs Prettier in check mode to ensure formatting is stable.
3. Executes the ESLint suite with the repository ruleset.
