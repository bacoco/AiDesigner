# Overview

Enforce design system rigor by guiding teams through translating discovery learnings into actionable UI specs. This Skill codifies AiDesigner’s front-end template, component governance, and accessibility checklists.

# When to Use

- Preparing UI deliverables after completing discovery and inspiration sessions.
- Auditing an existing interface against the Nano Banana design system.
- Onboarding new designers to the project’s component library and rationale.

# Workflow

1. **Review discovery inputs**
   - Import journey insights and tokens generated by the Discovery Journey Skill.
   - Map user needs to interface surfaces and interaction models.
2. **Define experience pillars**
   - Document guiding principles, tonal direction, and key flows in `aidesigner-core/templates/frontend/spec.md`.
   - Align with product and engineering stakeholders before moving to components.
3. **Component mapping**
   - Audit existing components in `front-end/design-system` for reuse.
   - Define new variants or patterns only when gaps exist, capturing rationale in the component inventory table.
   - Ensure accessibility requirements (WCAG AA minimum) are documented per component.
4. **Interaction and state detail**
   - Capture responsive breakpoints, error/empty/loading states, and motion cues.
   - Link to supporting prototypes or Figma files where available.
   - Validate copy and localization guidance.
5. **Handoff package**
   - Export the UI spec using `bin/aidesigner ui export --output artifacts/ui`.
   - Notify engineering teams and pair with Architecture QA for implementation planning.

# Checklists

- [ ] Principles and experience pillars confirmed with stakeholders.
- [ ] Component inventory updated with reuse decisions.
- [ ] Accessibility acceptance criteria documented.
- [ ] Interaction states covered across responsive breakpoints.
- [ ] Handoff bundle attached to tracking ticket or sprint board.

# Tips

- Reference the [**Architecture QA & Tech Stack Governance Skill**](../architecture-qa-tech-stack-governance/SKILL.md) to align component decisions with technical constraints.
- Invite QA early to validate accessibility and localization impacts.
- Maintain a changelog for component updates to inform future Skills.

# Next Steps

Transition to the **Architecture QA & Tech Stack Governance Skill** to verify the implementation plan preserves the design system commitments captured here.
