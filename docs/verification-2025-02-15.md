# Verification Report - 2025-02-15

## Summary

- `npm run build:mcp` completes successfully, rebuilding the compiled MCP assets and copying the latest hooks into `dist/mcp`.
- Targeted Jest suites continue to fail: orchestration workflows still emit error payloads because required tasks, templates, and checklists are missing, and GLM provider handling regressions persist in the CLI and client utilities.
- Each Jest invocation surfaces a haste module naming collision warning between the root `package.json` and `.dev/tools/installer/package.json`, indicating the tooling fixes have not resolved the underlying duplication.

## Detailed Findings

### Build

- `npm run build:mcp` recompiles the MCP TypeScript sources without errors and copies the hook scripts into the distribution directory, confirming the recent script changes run end-to-end. 【4b1d58†L1-L7】

### Test Failures

- Jest emits a haste map naming collision warning for duplicate `package.json` module IDs. 【780f30†L1-L10】
- The `run-orchestrator-server.integration.test.js` suite fails multiple expectations because the orchestrator returns error payloads instead of JSON, several agent dependencies (tasks, templates, checklists) are missing, and error messaging does not match assertions. 【c5021c†L1-L188】【c5021c†L189-L332】
- The `llm-client.test.js` suite reports GLM configuration regressions: environment variable propagation does not prioritize `ZHIPUAI_API_KEY`, and invalid base URLs fail to throw. 【efe457†L1-L24】
- The `assistant-env.test.js` suite shows that GLM-related CLI flags do not set the expected environment variables. 【efe457†L25-L56】

### Conclusion

The recent corrections do not currently stabilize the system. Build artifacts are generated successfully, but end-to-end orchestration tests and GLM provider flows still fail, and duplicate module identifiers remain unresolved. Until the missing knowledge assets are restored and GLM handling is fixed, shipping these changes would introduce regressions rather than improvements. 【4b1d58†L1-L7】【780f30†L1-L10】【c5021c†L189-L332】【efe457†L1-L56】

### Outstanding Work

- Address the GLM provider handling regressions highlighted by the `llm-client` and `assistant-env` tests.
- Restore the missing task/template/checklist assets required by `AidesignerBridge` so orchestration flows can execute without falling back to error payloads.
- Resolve the Jest haste module naming collision to avoid duplicate module resolutions during test discovery.

## Notes

- The Jest run was interrupted after collecting the failing diagnostics above because additional suites continued running without new failure modes. The issues listed here are blocking the suite from passing and should be resolved before rerunning the full test matrix.
