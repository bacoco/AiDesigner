# Overview

The AiDesigner proof-of-concept orchestrates a streamlined pipeline that turns inspected web UIs into reusable design artifacts. This document dissects the code paths involved in generating a Shadcn-based React page, highlighting responsibilities, data contracts, and improvement opportunities across inspection, inference, generation, and validation steps.

# System Flow

1. **CLI orchestration** – `apps/aidesigner-poc/src/cli.ts` wires the flow: capture target URL, derive tokens and component maps, generate React code, and compute reports. The CLI defends against missing arguments, isolates output per run, and surfaces high-level success or error status.
2. **Inspection** – `analyzeWithMCP` in `packages/mcp-inspector/src/index.ts` is a placeholder shim around a Chrome DevTools MCP server. It defines required artifacts (DOM snapshot, accessibility tree, CSSOM, computed styles, console output, performance trace, screenshots) and documents the intended RPC shape.
3. **Inference** – `inferTokens` and `detectComponents` in `packages/inference/src` translate inspection results into domain-aware assets:
   - `inferTokens` fabricates a `Tokens` object with canonical primitives (color, space, font) and semantic references. Production notes call for clustering colors, spacing step analysis, and font extraction from computed styles.
   - `detectComponents` emits a `ComponentMap` describing detection heuristics, variant/state metadata, accessibility expectations, and mapping templates for downstream generators.
4. **Code generation** – `buildShadcnPage` in `packages/codegen/src/react-shadcn.ts` materializes a minimal Next.js page that imports Shadcn UI primitives, injects theme styles derived from tokens, and scaffolds a layout using detected components.
5. **Reporting** – `generateDriftReport` in `apps/aidesigner-poc/src/generate-reports.ts` validates foundational design health by calculating contrast ratios and spacing drift based on the inferred tokens.

# UI Design Responsibilities

## Design Token Inference

- **Current behavior**: `inferTokens` outputs hard-coded fallback tokens (`base/fg`, `base/bg`, `brand/600`, etc.) with notes on desired heuristics for production. Constraints default to 4 px spacing steps and 2 px border radii.
- **Intended heuristics**: Comments describe extracting colors from computed styles, clustering similar hues (e.g., k-medoids), and estimating spacing grids via GCD or histograms. Fonts should be parsed from CSS `font-family` declarations to capture families and weight sets.
- **Risk**: Without real analysis, generated themes may diverge significantly from the inspected UI, undermining the design system fidelity and any validation that depends on the token set.

## Component Detection

- **Structure**: Each entry in `ComponentMap` includes detection signals (`role`, `classesLike`, CSS `patterns`), enumerated `variants` and `states`, optional accessibility requirements, and string templates that map to specific UI libraries (Shadcn, MUI, etc.).
- **Extensibility**: The map supports multiple output libraries via `mappings`, enabling cross-framework code generation once detection heuristics confirm a component match.
- **Limitations**: Present heuristics are placeholders—returning a static `Button` and `Card` definition regardless of input. Real detection would analyze ARIA roles, recurring classnames, and CSS traits within the DOM snapshot and accessibility tree.

## Shadcn Page Generation

- **Path handling**: `buildShadcnPage` resolves the output directory relative to `process.cwd()` and blocks path traversal via relative path checks before writing files.
- **Theme synthesis**: Inline CSS variables (`--fg`, `--bg`) derive from token primitives, while the body font family adopts `tokens.primitives.font.sans.family`. This effectively applies inferred brand styling to the generated preview.
- **Component instantiation**: The current template hardcodes a hero section with a `Button` and a `Card`. Component detection results (`comps`) are not yet consumed, leaving room for expanding layout synthesis based on real detection metadata.
- **Resilience**: File writes are wrapped in a try/catch to emit actionable errors when generation fails, promoting robustness inside larger automation workflows.

## Design Validation

- **Contrast**: `contrastRatio` computes WCAG-compliant contrast by converting hex colors to linear luminance and applying the (L1+0.05)/(L2+0.05) formula.
- **Spacing**: `validateSpacing` compares actual spacing values to the nearest multiple of a design step, averaging drift to quantify scale adherence.
- **Grid Alignment**: `validateGridAlignment` evaluates how many elements align to a multiple of the grid size across position and dimensions.
- **Reporting integration**: The proof-of-concept currently leverages only the contrast check and spacing defaults to produce a `drift.json` summary. Hooking the spacing and grid validators to actual layout metrics would deepen the design QA signal.

# Gaps and Recommendations

1. **Integrate real MCP data** – Implement the commented MCP calls and normalize responses so inference operates on authentic DOM, CSS, and accessibility data.
2. **Token extraction heuristics** – Build color clustering, spacing frequency analysis, and font extraction to replace the stubbed token map. This unlocks accurate theming, accessible contrast calculations, and trustworthy spacing reports.
3. **Component matching engine** – Leverage DOM semantics, ARIA roles, and style patterns to dynamically populate `ComponentMap`, then drive `buildShadcnPage` to instantiate detected components rather than hard-coded scaffolding.
4. **Layout synthesis** – Translate component detection into structured layout sections (e.g., grids, hero, navigation). Combine component templates with spacing constraints to mirror source UIs more closely.
5. **Validation coverage** – Feed actual spacing measurements and element bounding boxes (from the DOM snapshot) into `validateSpacing` and `validateGridAlignment` to provide actionable drift metrics alongside contrast results.
6. **Token-mode support** – Extend `Tokens.modes` to capture light/dark variants discovered during inspection, enabling the generator to emit theme-aware CSS and preview toggles.

# Conclusion

The UI design pipeline establishes a clear contract between inspection, inference, generation, and validation layers, but currently operates with placeholder heuristics. Prioritizing authentic data extraction, component intelligence, and validation depth will transform the proof-of-concept into a production-grade UI regeneration tool that maintains brand fidelity and accessibility standards.
