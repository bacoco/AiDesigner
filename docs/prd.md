## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

1. Codify an end-to-end workflow that converts ideas into architecture and working code via coordinated AI agents.
2. Provide a consistent zero-knowledge interface so users can operate the platform without learning prompt engineering jargon.
3. Enable dual runtime (IDE CLI + web UI) with identical capabilities and shared artifacts.
4. Integrate Chrome DevTools MCP, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Nano Banana to generate design references and enforce fidelity.
5. Maintain compliance, auditability, and security guardrails suitable for enterprise usage.

### Background Context

AiDesigner evolved from the BMAD methodology to remove friction between product discovery, design, and implementation. Current assets ‚Äî including the Chrome MCP strategy pack and POC kit ‚Äî validate phase-specific capabilities but lack a single governing PRD. The platform orchestrates specialized agents (PM, Architect, UX, Implementation) under an invisible coordinator so teams can move from ideation through code generation without context loss.

Market demand centers on AI copilots that produce production-grade outputs rather than drafts. Competitors remain siloed (design-only or code-only). AiDesigner differentiates by chaining decisions across artifacts: PRDs flow into architecture templates, UI prompts, and story plans. This PRD consolidates scope, defines success criteria, and sequences delivery epics so the engineering organization can industrialize the experience for both IDE and browser environments.

10. NFR10: Offline mode must allow CLI usage with cached tools and replay once connectivity resumes, with clear status messaging.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

Deliver a cohesive conversational workspace where multidisciplinary teams collaborate in a single timeline. The UI should surface lane transitions, artifact previews, and recommended next steps without overwhelming the user, emphasizing clarity and progressive disclosure.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

- Conversational thread with inline artifact cards (PRD, architecture, stories) and action chips for follow-up commands.
- Split view toggling between chat history, design canvas (Gemini/Nano Banana renders), and code previews.
- Context pinning that allows users to highlight brief excerpts or design references that persist across lanes.
- Guided checklists that appear when a workflow reaches a validation gate (e.g., PM checklist before architecture handoff).

### Core Screens and Views

- Unified Conversation Workspace (chat + artifact sidebar)
- Design Insight Studio (Chrome MCP inspector + Nano Banana preview)
- Implementation Control Center (story queue, code diff viewer, checklist status)
- Administration Dashboard (tooling configuration, rate limits, audit logs)

### Accessibility: WCAG AA

Adopt high-contrast themes, semantic landmarks, and full keyboard/screen reader support. Provide motion-reduction preferences for animated design previews and ensure time-based interactions (e.g., auto-refresh of Gemini renders) offer pause controls.

### Branding

Leverage AiDesigner‚Äôs existing brand tokens (deep purple primary, neon accent) documented in the POC kit. Visual language should communicate professionalism with subtle futuristic cues‚Äîglow edges, circuit-inspired dividers‚Äîwhile remaining minimalistic.

### Target Device and Platforms: Cross-Platform

Support responsive web (desktop, tablet, mobile) and provide parity with the IDE via command-line prompts and artifact rendering within Markdown previews. Ensure component layouts degrade gracefully on smaller viewports without losing key controls.

### Assumptions & Open Questions

- Confirm licensing and usage limits for Gemini 2.5 Flash image generation in commercial environments.
- Validate whether Nano Banana outputs can be cached for offline review in regulated industries.
- Determine if enterprise customers require self-hosted storage for captured design tokens.

## Implementation Scope & Technical Preferences

### Repository Structure: Monorepo

Continue the Nx-style monorepo with shared packages (`@aidesigner/*`) separating core logic, UI apps, and toolchains. Enforce dependency rules so shared utilities flow outward without circular imports.

### Service Architecture

Adopt a modular monolith with clearly delineated service domains (planning, design, implementation) exposing internal APIs. Critical integrations (MCP server, Gemini/Nano Banana connectors) run as sidecar services but share the monorepo for configuration consistency.

### Testing Requirements

Implement the full testing pyramid: unit tests for agents and utilities, integration tests for workflow orchestration, and end-to-end smoke tests covering IDE and web experiences. Introduce contract tests for MCP interactions to catch upstream API shifts.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

- Provide feature flags to toggle experimental agents without redeploying the platform.
- Introduce telemetry hooks to capture agent reasoning spans for later analytics.
- Require secure sandboxing for browser automation to prevent leakage of customer data when inspecting sites.
- Document fallback strategies if external AI services throttle or degrade (e.g., switch to cached responses, queue requests).
