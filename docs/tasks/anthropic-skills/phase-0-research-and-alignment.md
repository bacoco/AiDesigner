# Phase 0 â€“ Research & Alignment Tasks

## Objectives

- Establish a shared understanding of Anthropic Skill requirements.
- Identify which AiDesigner assets are best suited for conversion into Skills.

## Task List

- [ ] Compile canonical references for Anthropic Skills, including folder structure, `SKILL.md` frontmatter schema, progressive disclosure guidelines, and executable asset constraints.
- [ ] Map current AiDesigner asset types (agents, tasks, templates, checklists, deliverables) to prospective Skill folder sections and note any gaps.
- [ ] Interview core maintainers to validate assumptions about high-value workflows and capture undocumented tribal knowledge.
- [ ] Produce a comparison matrix that highlights how existing bridge/export tooling can feed the Skill pipeline and where new adapters are required.
- [ ] Prioritize candidate Skills (e.g., Discovery Journey, Architecture QA) with rough impact vs. effort scoring to inform Phase 6 seeding.

## Deliverables

- Research brief summarizing Anthropic requirements and implications for AiDesigner architecture.
- Candidate Skill catalog with prioritization notes and owning teams.
