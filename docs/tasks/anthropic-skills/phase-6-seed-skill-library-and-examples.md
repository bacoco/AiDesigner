# Phase 6 – Seed Skill Library & Examples Tasks

## Objectives

- Deliver a curated set of ready-to-install Skills derived from AiDesigner workflows.
- Provide executable examples and tests that prove Skill quality.

## Task List

- [ ] Select high-impact workflows (Discovery Journey, UI Design System Lock-In, Architecture QA, Agile Story Writer) and map their assets to Skill templates.
- [ ] Generate initial Skill bundles using the authoring pipeline and review for instruction quality, progressive disclosure, and asset completeness.
- [ ] Develop optional executable helpers (e.g., spreadsheet validators, presentation generators) where deterministic automation adds value.
- [ ] Create automated tests or validation scripts ensuring each Skill’s assets resolve correctly and no broken references remain.
- [ ] Write usage notes for each Skill, including prerequisites, expected inputs, and typical outputs.
- [ ] Package seed Skills for distribution (compressed archives, npm artifacts, or Git bundles) with version metadata.
- [ ] Coordinate with design and documentation teams to capture screenshots or walkthroughs demonstrating Skill usage.

## Deliverables

- Published seed Skill library stored in version control and/or distribution channels.
- Documentation set describing each seed Skill and associated executable helpers.
