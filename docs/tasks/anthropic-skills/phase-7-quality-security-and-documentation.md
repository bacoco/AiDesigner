# Phase 7 â€“ Quality, Security, and Documentation Tasks

**Master Plan Reference**: [Anthropic Skills Integration Plan](../../plans/anthropic-skills-integration.md)

## Objectives

- Institutionalize validation, security, and educational materials for Skills.
- Ensure ongoing maintenance processes keep Skills trustworthy.

## Dependencies

- **Upstream**: Early tasks can begin in parallel with Phase 2-5; late tasks require Phase 6 completion
- **Downstream**: None (final phase)

## Phase Execution Strategy

This phase has two tiers:

**Early (parallel with Phase 2-5)**:
- Design validation schemas and tooling
- Create security checklist templates
- Wire validation into CI pipelines

**Late (after Phase 6)**:
- Execute comprehensive validation on seed library
- Finalize training materials
- Launch usage analytics (local only)

## Task List

- [ ] Build linting and validation routines (frontmatter schema, markdown lint, asset existence) and wire them into `npm run validate`, `npm run pre-release`, and `.github/workflows/` CI pipelines.
- [ ] Define security review checklists for executable assets, including sandboxing expectations (Anthropic security model), dependency scanning, and manual code audits.
- [ ] Integrate Skill validation into release gates, preventing publication of malformed bundles.
- [ ] Update user guides, MCP documentation, and developer onboarding materials with Skill workflows (generate, edit, publish, roll back).
- [ ] Author a migration guide describing how existing projects can export accumulated knowledge into Skills.
- [ ] Provide training materials or internal workshops to roll out Skill processes to teams.
- [ ] Establish local-only analytics mechanisms that respect privacy (stored in project state, no external reporting) for capturing Skill usage insights.

## Deliverables

- Automated validation suite integrated into `npm run validate` and CI workflows (`.github/workflows/pr-validation.yml`).
- Security checklist artifacts and review processes documented in `docs/security/skills-security-checklist.md`.
- Comprehensive documentation updates:
  - User guide updates: `docs/user-guide.md`
  - MCP documentation: `docs/mcp-management.md`
  - Migration guide: `docs/guides/migrating-to-skills.md`
- Training assets published to `docs/training/skills-workshop.md`.

## Test Strategy Integration

Per master plan test strategy section:

**Unit Test Coverage**:
- 80%+ coverage target for Skill authoring pipeline (Phase 2)
- Jest framework (existing test infrastructure per CLAUDE.md lines 204-210)

**Integration Tests**:
- Skill generation from sample AiDesigner assets
- CLI command execution (generate, validate, list)
- Workflow integration (Skills emitted alongside existing artifacts)

**CI/CD Integration**:
- Validation checks in `.github/workflows/pr-validation.yml`
- `npm run pre-release` includes Skill validation
- Automated tests run on all PRs touching Skill-related code

## Security Review Process

**Sandboxing Expectations**:
- Document Anthropic's security model for executable Skill assets
- Define AiDesigner-specific hardening measures beyond Anthropic baseline
- Dependency scanning for npm packages included in executable helpers

**Threat Modeling**:
- Identify attack vectors for malicious Skill bundles
- Define validation gates preventing distribution of unsafe Skills
- Document incident response procedures

## Privacy & Telemetry

Per AiDesigner's local-first principle (README.md lines 132-136):
- **No external telemetry**: All analytics stored locally in project state
- **User control**: Opt-in for local usage tracking
- **Transparency**: Clear documentation of what data is collected and where it's stored

## File Locations

- **Validation Suite**: `packages/validators/src/skill-validators.ts`
- **CI Integration**: `.github/workflows/pr-validation.yml`
- **Security Checklists**: `docs/security/skills-security-checklist.md`
- **User Documentation**: `docs/user-guide.md`, `docs/guides/migrating-to-skills.md`
- **Training Materials**: `docs/training/skills-workshop.md`
