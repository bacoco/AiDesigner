# Phase 7 â€“ Quality, Security, and Documentation Tasks

## Objectives

- Institutionalize validation, security, and educational materials for Skills.
- Ensure ongoing maintenance processes keep Skills trustworthy.

## Task List

- [ ] Build linting and validation routines (frontmatter schema, markdown lint, asset existence) and wire them into `npm run validate` and CI pipelines.
- [ ] Define security review checklists for executable assets, including sandboxing expectations, dependency scanning, and manual code audits.
- [ ] Integrate Skill validation into release gates, preventing publication of malformed bundles.
- [ ] Update user guides, MCP documentation, and developer onboarding materials with Skill workflows (generate, edit, publish, roll back).
- [ ] Author a migration guide describing how existing projects can export accumulated knowledge into Skills.
- [ ] Provide training materials or internal workshops to roll out Skill processes to teams.
- [ ] Establish telemetry or feedback mechanisms that respect privacy while capturing Skill usage insights for future improvements.

## Deliverables

- Automated validation suite and security checklist artifacts stored in the repository.
- Comprehensive documentation updates and training assets published to `docs/`.
