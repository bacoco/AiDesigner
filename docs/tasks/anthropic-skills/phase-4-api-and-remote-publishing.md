# Phase 4 – API & Remote Publishing Tasks

## Objectives

- Expose server-side services to manage Skill publishing via Anthropic APIs.
- Support long-running operations with reliable status reporting.

## Task List

- [ ] Implement a `SkillService` module in `packages/api-server` responsible for rendering Skill bundles, validating payloads, and invoking Anthropic’s `/v1/skills` endpoints.
- [ ] Add configuration for Anthropic credentials (API keys, workspace IDs) with secure storage and rotation guidance.
- [ ] Create REST endpoints (e.g., `POST /skills/publish`, `GET /skills`, `POST /skills/validate`) along with request/response schemas and OpenAPI documentation.
- [ ] Integrate background job processing (queue or worker) to handle asset uploads and status polling with retry logic.
- [ ] Implement structured logging and error handling that surfaces actionable messages to clients and operations dashboards.
- [ ] Write integration tests using mocked Anthropic APIs to validate happy paths, error conditions, and retry behavior.
- [ ] Document operational runbooks covering credential setup, rate limits, and troubleshooting steps.

## Deliverables

- Server release including new Skill service, routes, and background job workers.
- API documentation and runbooks published to `docs/` or the developer portal.
